          <Card.Text>This is the Metro Museum of Art, the most visited art museum in the western hemisphere. This application utilizes a back-end API that handles both calls to this 
            museum&apos;s API and actions with the user database, using the express framework. The database is hosted by MongoDB Atlas. The front-end work is all done with React JS. This 
            project was completed on April 8, 2023, and you can learn more about the museum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here.</a>
